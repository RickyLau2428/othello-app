# An Implementation of Othello

## A Quick Description

Othello is a 2-player board game played on a 8x8 board. My application aims to simulate an Othello game that can be 
played on a computer, faithful to the original rules as provided by the World Othello Federation
(rules found here https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english).

As a quick summary, my application will be able to: 
* Do whatever an Othello board can do and **more**.
* Store a current game to be finished at another time.
* (Pending - more things to be added as I think of them)

## Who is this for?
My application can be used by absolutely anybody who has an interest in playing Othello, from those who have never 
heard of it to veteran players. As long as you have two players (or maybe just one if you enjoy playing
against yourself), this application will satisfy *most* of your Othello needs.

## Why Othello?
I was inspired to design my project around Othello by watching gameplay on YouTube. To be completely frank, I've never 
played the game before, but I felt that it translated into a program fairly well and would be fun to implement.
