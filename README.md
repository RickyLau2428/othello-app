# An Implementation of Othello

## A Quick Description

Othello is a 2-player board game played on a 8x8 board. My application aims to simulate an Othello game that can be 
played on a computer, faithful to the original rules as provided by the World Othello Federation
(rules found here https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english).

As a quick summary, my application will be able to: 
* Do whatever an Othello board can do and **more**<sup>1</sup>.
* Store a current game to be finished at another time.
* (Pending - more things to be added as I think of them)

## Who is this for?
My application can be used by absolutely anybody who has an interest in playing Othello, from those who have never 
heard of it<sup>2</sup> to veteran players. As long as you have two players (or maybe just one if you enjoy playing
against yourself), this application will satisfy *most* of your Othello needs.

## Why Othello?
I've never actually played Othello before, so I consider this as a chance to learn more about the game in-depth from
an implementation perspective.
