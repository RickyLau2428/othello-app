# An Implementation of Othello

## A Quick Description

Othello is a 2-player board game played on a 8x8 board. My application aims to simulate an Othello game that can be 
played on a computer, faithful to the original rules as provided by the World Othello Federation
(rules found here https://www.worldothello.org/about/about-othello/othello-rules/official-rules/english).

As a quick summary, my application will be able to: 
* Do whatever an Othello board can do and **more**.
* Store a current game to be finished at another time.
* Upon request, provide a list of all valid moves that can be taken.

## Who is this for?
My application can be used by absolutely anybody who has an interest in playing Othello, from those who have never 
heard of it to veteran players. As long as you have two players (or maybe just one if you enjoy playing
against yourself), this application will satisfy most of your Othello needs.


## Conclusion
It's pretty simple to use, so go ahead - launch the app and have some fun with it!
